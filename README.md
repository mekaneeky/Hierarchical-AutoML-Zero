# Hivetrain AutoML Subnet

Welcome to Hivetrain's open-source, distributed AutoML subnet!

## About

Hivetrain is back with an innovative approach to distributed AutoML. Our goal is to tackle JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber's challenge of "inventing an AI scientist smarter than himself so that he can retire". We're creating an incentivization structure that rewards the development of improved neural network components and potentially new algorithms that surpass the current state-of-the-art.

## Current Focus

Currently running on Bittensor testnet-100, we're starting with a loss function search. This is just the beginning of our journey into distributed AutoML. 

## Participation

### As a Miner

You have two main approaches as a miner:

1. **Rely on Brains:**
   - Develop new functions in the target optimization area and write algorithms in our genetic format.
   - Create better optimization approaches than our default offerings.
   - Design more efficient miners to maximize your available compute resources.

2. **Rely on Compute:**
   - If you have substantial computational resources:
     - Run an independent miner.
     - Join a mining pool (Work in Progress).
     - Run a miner on the mining pool (note: rewards will be shared with other miners).

### As a Validator

We welcome validators and are committed to supporting you. We can assist with setup, automation, cost-reduction, and other measures to reduce friction. Please note: Do not copy weights.

## FAQs

**Q: Is there research backing your claims?**  
A: Yes, our work is inspired by and based on several research papers:
- [AutoML-Zero: Evolving Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03384)
- [Lion: Adversarial Distillation of Closed-Source Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06675)
- For more AutoML research areas, refer to the [AutoML Conference 2024](https://2024.automl.cc/)

**Q: Are you done with distributed training?**  
A: Distributed training is a technically complex problem. We're still developing our solution, and our candidate approach is not yet ready for release.
